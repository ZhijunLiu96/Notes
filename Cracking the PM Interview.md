## The Product Manager Role <a name="chapter2"> </a>

### What is a PM?
- A PM is responsible for making sure that a team ships a great product.
- A mini-CEO of the product

### Function of a PM

Some companies or teams split the product manager role across two people: the more business-focused person and the more engineering-focused person. When companies make this split, they call the engineering-focused person the technical program manager or technical product manager (TPM), and they call the business-focused person the product manager (PM).
